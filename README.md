# PAIDAMOYO - JANET "MYLES" AZEHKO
## This is my web developement portfolio.  I wanted to build a smaller site for myself separate from Project Erostribe so that I could start applying to jobs.  I built this website during my 3 month contract as a TA at Code Crews coding bootcamp (March - May 2021).  

The Goal of this portfolio is to show off the knowledge I've gained in my 2 year journey into learning to code.  Each page is crafted using a different language or technology and each page will be explained further below.

### README.MD:
I created this page to show off my Markdown.md skills.  I wanted this to also act as a table of contents for how the page runs and what code does what where.  I also wanted to take you alog with me on the journey of building this website.  I had been pondering how to build this for almost a year. I bought the domain (www.JanetAzehko.com) at the beginning of the pandemic with the intent to have it built in about 6 months.

That clearly didn't happen.  What did happen however was too much thought and not enough building.  I pondered what the site should look like, and then realised that what I wanted to build and what I needed to build were two separate things entirely.

I wanted to build a really impressive site where people would get to see my art, buy my clothing and get to know me.  What I needed to build was a site that explained the origins of my online personal Advocate Myles, the Computer Programmer.  It really needed to be something simple that told my story (why I started coding), showed off my work, and let people contact me via a form.

From there I built a wireframe of what I wanted the website to look like on Mockplus (www.mockplus.com/).  That helped me visualise the experience I wanted my user to have.  I knew that I wanted the page to scroll down in one continuous section, reagardless of the fact that I built each part independently (to begin with). Then I started looking for tutorials that I could code along with to get the functionality of the site (JavaScript) working enough to have a functional menu.
